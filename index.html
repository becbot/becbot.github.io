I am a soon-to-be graduated PhD student at Jacobs University Bremen as part of the Marie-Curie Innovative Training Network [ANIMATAS](animatas.eu). I currently live in Paris and am working as a visiting researcher at the Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique at Sorbonne Université. I have a Bachelor of Psychological Science (Honours First Class) from the University of Queensland, Australia (2016). My dissertation centres on the conceptualisation and measurement of children’s trust in robots, and in particular, the occurrence of robot errors during child-robot interactions. More generally, I am passionate about how psychology can be combined with technology, and am vocal about the importance of psychology in both research and industry settings. If you're interested in more about psychology and robots, head over to [PsyBots](psybots.github.io) which is a side project I am working on with [Benedikt Leichtmann](https://twitter.com/bleichtmann?lang=en). 

Outside of my research, I enjoy staying active with a rotating mix of yoga, running, workouts, and climbing (pick any 2 :wink:), which is good because I also enjoy slowly eating my way through the cheeses of Europe :cheese: . Pre-covid, I also enjoy travelling for both work and personal trips. 

On this website you can find a combination of both my research and personal interests. If you are interested in getting in touch, head on over to the contact page :blush:
