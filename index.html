I am a soon-to-be graduated PhD student at Jacobs University Bremen as part of the Marie-Curie Innovative Training Network <a href="animatas.eu">ANIMATAS</a>. I currently live in Paris and am working as a visiting researcher at the Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique at Sorbonne Université. I am originally from Brisbane, Australia, and hold a Bachelor of Psychological Science (Honours First Class) from the University of Queensland, Australia (2016). My dissertation centres on the conceptualisation and measurement of children’s trust in robots, and in particular, the occurrence of robot errors during child-robot interactions. I am skilled at research design, theory, and measurement, including quantitative statistical analyses. Throughout my PhD studies I have been involved in multiple interdisciplinary collaborations and published in both journals and peer-reviewed conference proceedings. I also enjoy presenting my work to both general and academic audiences. Last year, I was invited to give a talk at PyLadies Hamburg on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA573F7yBFE">Intersection of Robotics and Psychology</a> which you can view on my <a href="https://becbot.github.io/media/">Media</a> Page.

More generally, I am passionate about the intersection of psychology and technology and how psychological research methods can be applied to digital industries.  I am also highly involved with open science and have contributed to multiple interdisciplinary and cross-industry events throughout my PhD, including the organisation of two workshops; <a href="https://child-robot-interaction.github.io/">Interdisciplinary Research Methods for Child-Robot Relationship Formation</a>, and <a href="http://cs.umanitoba.ca/~umgeiskk/">Child-Robot Interaction for Beginners: Supporting New Researchers (CRIB) </a>. I have also founded a community for psychologists and social scientists interested in human robot interaction, <a href="psybots.github.io">PsyBots</a>, which is also active on <a href="https://twitter.com/psy4bots">twitter</a>.

Outside of my research, I enjoy staying active with a rotating mix of yoga, running, workouts, and climbing (pick any 2!), which is good because I also enjoy slowly eating my way through the cheeses of Europe. When we are not in a pandemic, I also enjoy travelling for both work and personal trips.

On this website you can find a combination of both my research and personal interests. If you are interested in getting in touch, you can find all my contact details at the bottom of the page.
