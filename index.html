I am a soon-to-be graduated PhD student at Jacobs University Bremen. I currently live in Paris as a visiting researcher at the Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique at Sorbonne Université. I have a Bachelor of Psychological Science (Honours First Class) from the University of Queensland, Australia (2016). My dissertation centres on the conceptualisation and measurement of children’s trust in robots, and in particular, the occurrence of robot errors during child-robot interactions. Outside of my research, I enjoy staying active with yoga and climbing, as well as travelling (pre-covid!)
