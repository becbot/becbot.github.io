I recently started a postdoc position at the division of Robotics, Perception, and Learning, at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Paris8 <a href="http://www.cognition-usages.org/chart2/">CHArt Laboratory</a> in collaboration with the Laboratory of Intuitive and Natural Interactions with Teleoperated Robots (<a href="https://initrobots.ca/">INIT</a>) in Montreal. I defended my PhD dissertation in October, 2021 as part of the Marie-Curie Innovative Training Network <a href="animatas.eu">ANIMATAS</a>. My dissertation centred on the conceptualisation and measurement of robot failures during child-robot interaction. I am originally from Brisbane, Australia, where I also completed a Bachelor of Psychological Science (Honours First Class) from the University of Queensland (2016). Currently, I am working on swarm robotics and am interested in the conceptualization of social intelligence in robots and the design of social robot behavior. I am skilled at research design, theory, and measurement, including quantitative statistical analyses. I have been involved in multiple interdisciplinary collaborations and published in both journals and peer-reviewed conference proceedings. I also enjoy presenting my work to both general and academic audiences. You can view some of the presentations I have given on my <a href="https://becbot.github.io/media/">Media</a> Page.

More generally, I am passionate about the intersection of psychology and technology and how psychological research methods can be applied to digital industries.  I am also highly involved with open science and have contributed to multiple interdisciplinary and cross-industry events, including the organisation of two workshops; <a href="https://child-robot-interaction.github.io/">Interdisciplinary Research Methods for Child-Robot Relationship Formation</a>, and <a href="http://cs.umanitoba.ca/~umgeiskk/">Child-Robot Interaction for Beginners: Supporting New Researchers (CRIB) </a>.

Outside of my research, I enjoy staying active with a rotating mix of yoga, <a href="https://afleurope.org/afl-explained/">australian football</a>, netball, and climbing (pick any 2!), which is good because I also enjoy slowly eating my way through the cheeses of Europe. When we are not in a pandemic, I also enjoy travelling for both work and personal trips.

On this website you can find a combination of both my research and personal interests. If you are interested in getting in touch, you can find all my contact details at the bottom of the page.
