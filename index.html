I currently work as a postdoctoral researcher at the division of Robotics, Perception, and Learning, at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. Previously, I worked as a researcher at Paris8 <a href="http://www.cognition-usages.org/chart2/">CHArt Laboratory</a> in collaboration with the Laboratory of Intuitive and Natural Interactions with Teleoperated Robots (<a href="https://initrobots.ca/">INIT</a>) in Montreal. I defended my PhD dissertation in October, 2021 as part of the Marie-Curie Innovative Training Network <a href="animatas.eu">ANIMATAS</a>. My dissertation centred on the conceptualisation and measurement of robot failures during child-robot interactions.

I am originally from Brisbane, Australia, where I also completed a Bachelor of Psychological Science (Honours First Class) from the University of Queensland (2016). Currently, I am interested in the role of robot failures during different kinds of human-robot interactions (e.g., social robots, cobots, swarms). I am skilled at research design, theory, and measurement, including quantitative statistical analyses. I have been involved in multiple interdisciplinary collaborations and published in both journals and peer-reviewed conference proceedings. I also enjoy presenting my work to both general and academic audiences. You can view some of the presentations I have given on my <a href="https://becbot.github.io/media/">Media</a> Page.

More generally, I am passionate about the intersection of psychology and technology and how psychological research methods can be applied to digital industries.  I am also highly involved with open science and have contributed to multiple interdisciplinary and cross-industry events, including the organisation of a recurring workshop; <a href="https://child-robot-interaction.github.io/">CRITTER: Child-Robot Interaction and Interdisciplinary Research</a>

Outside of my research, I enjoy staying active with a rotating mix of yoga, <a href="https://afleurope.org/afl-explained/">australian football</a>, netball, and climbing (pick any 2!), which is good because I also enjoy slowly eating my way through the cheeses of Europe. I also enjoy travelling for both work and personal trips.

On this website you can find a combination of both my research and personal interests. If you are interested in getting in touch, you can find my contact details at the bottom of the page.
